 * Name: Victoria Stephany Huisman Sigcha
 * Student nr.: 491775@student.saxion.nl
 * Class: ETI1V.ID
 * Description: New implementation of a C program in C++. Maybe a little messy for now, but I literally just
 *      finished it, and I want to sleep. Anyway... Didn't change the messages.in file or implement a while-loop
 *      menu due to no instruction. I strictly followed the .pdf like religion, so everything should be as asked.
